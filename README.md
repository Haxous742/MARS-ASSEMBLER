## GCD MIPS Code
The code implements the Recursive Steinâ€™s Algorithm to compute the GCD of two numbers. After assembling, it will prompt for two numbers and display the result.

## Binary Search Code
After assembling, the program will:
1. Ask for the number of integers in the array.

2. Prompt for the starting address of the array (e.g., 268501216).

3. Require input of the sorted numbers one by one.

4. Ask for the target number to search.

If the number is found, the output will display its index (0-indexed); otherwise, it will state that the number was not found.

## Assembler
The assembler takes an `.asm` or `.txt` file as input and writes the machine code to **Machine_code.txt**.

For giving the input file, we have to put the file name at this location 
and compile the code:

Output file:

After compiling, the machine code will be available in the output file 
and the process the assembler went with will be displayed in the cmd 
lines:

## Comparator
This tool checks two text files: **Assembled.txt** and **Original.txt**. It confirms if the files are identical or displays the lines with mismatches.

### How to Run the Comparator:
```bash
python Compare.py Original.txt Assembled.txt
```

## DISCLAIMER-
While giving the input to the assembler, we have to give the entire 
file including the .data segment as well, as it will use that to make 
address references for the data segments as well, and when we 
compare the assembled text with the MARS machine code, the 
mismatches shown are all address mis-matches of the .data segment 
as the assembler is not able to precisely calculate the address of all 
the .data segments as the MARS simulator, apart from that 
everything else should match. 

##  The instruction included in the assembler are:
  1.   Li 
  2.   Ble 
  3.   La 
  4.   Jal 
  5.   J 
  6.   Addi 
  7.   Or 
  8.   Andi 
  9.   Bne 
  10.  Srl 
  11.  Beq 
  12.  Sub 
  13.  Sllv 
  14.  Jr 
  15.  And 
  16.  Sll 
  17.  Lw 
  18.  Sw 
  19.  Slt 
  20.  Syscall
